# YouTube Fast Forward/Rewind 5s Extension

A Chrome extension that adds custom 5-second fast-forward and rewind buttons beside the YouTube video timer.

**Note:** This extension is designed for **mouse users**. If you primarily use keyboard shortcuts, YouTube already has built-in shortcuts (Left/Right arrow keys skip backward/forward by 5 seconds) that work without any extension.
